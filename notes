particle generation

level and map generation
ok so i have basicim trying to figure out how best to implement enemy generation. My game is a top down shooter kinda like binding of Xeno Crisis, Binding of Isaac, Smash TV. Its 2D twin stick, but anyway Xeno Crisis and Smash TV have the enemies coming through the doors to other rooms, In Xeno Crisis (can't remember Smash TV) the doors can be on any wall (i think it generates the map (like rooms and which rooms are adjacent based on rules) then generates doors on appropriate walls (any of the panels on the wall as the oor only takes 1 of the lik 4 or 5 wall panels)
