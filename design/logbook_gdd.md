## **Setting**
time : modern maybe slightly future (2040)
takes place in US
generally the same maybe more battle scarred
essentially supernatural beings of all types have started appearing all over the world and causing chaos. Especially near cities and especially important ones (power/financially)
corporate interests have set up private military groups to combat threat
humans hate the supernatural beings

</details>
you chose a character from a group of humans and monsters (a rag tag lol) that naturally come together to fight the forces of evil (satan and his demons)
 
## **Opening scene** 

We follow a new recruit into (need name) organization. They are a military/defense force created by corporate interests (Meta, Google, Apple) maybe not all but yeah. Opens to recruit in APC (red lighting) sitting next to others in his squad. APC doors open and they run out to immediate engagement/firefight (sounds of gunfire screaming, fade to black). Fad back in recruit is bloodied, camera pans up to reveal a vampire with his clawed hands about to rip out the recruits throat. Flash (bright light)and *bang* come too to find a clothed vampire has put his fist through the others abdomen killing him. The recruit is helped up by the saving vamp confused ( humans are meant to hate all supernatural beings). Just then a second squad comes in (led by major authority in organization, they are clad in serious exoskeleton/power armour). He is surprised to see the recruit alive, he then notices the vamp who had helped him. Looking like he was allied with the vamp he orders his squad to take out the recruit and the vamp unloading a flurry of arms while running toward them.Suddenly time stops and angel (by the looks of it, high tech white slightly larger than a normal person basically idealized beauty and form (athletic)), he explains he stopped time, but it wont hold forever (the demon tech will find the time algorithm he has attached them to and time will resume). Confused, he continues to explain how the heads of these organizations obtained their power by entering into contracts with demonic forces, receiving tech and influence from them. The angel tells the recruit he has been selected by the angelic forces to help restore order/combat the demonic forces. The recruit accepts and the vamp agrees to help. The angel looks to him and says "this changes nothing" basically the vampire is still destined to go to hell when he dies. The vampire accepts and states how he just wants to do what he can to right his wrongs and the wrongs of his people. The game starts

World Building ::

Many world/corporate leaders have gotten power by communicating (through occult practices and dreams) with demonic forces that live in another dimension similar to the warp (40k). The demons have fed them the rituals and tech in exchange for their souls/allegiance. In a way none of this is "supernatural" in that clearly it's all always been a part of reality, but it is supernatural in that most people never come in contact/interact with these things. Essentially it's the answer to the fermi paradox, basically humans were made. They developed ultra advanced technology to where they conquered much of the milky way civilization. At a point they were able to even warp reality itself. They found runes and spells that are essentially programming for reality itself. World was peaceful, beautiful, basically a Utopia (no nations or tribalism)

They altered their bodies blending it with biological modifications, tech (and biotech(organs)), and runes (etched into their skeletons)
- enhanced durability
- enhanced endurance
- enhanced strength
- enhanced intelligence
- enhanced creativity
- no need to sleep (though they could)
- no need to eat (eternal energy absorbed from around them)
- no need to excrete energy was gained and used directly, and any needed resources are absorbed from around them directly (element/amino acids etc. )
- they can communicate in what could be described as telepathically but it wasn't their mind sending/receiving but more the runes transmitting ideas and context through the aether directly to others thought process
- they could literally create power blasts and modify the universe around them through their will as the runes/tech would work in conjunction to make it so
- they were now much beyond the beings they started as and were essentially gods (lowercase g, as they did create existence but could modify it to their will within the bounds of certain inherent rules (like they couldnt for example stip gravity from existing as a concept))
- limited ability to see through time/cause and effect (too many possibilities to see everything/can only see so far into future, /all possibilities are still possible but demons can manipulate events by focusing on most likely scenarios)

These being had now become what humans call angels. While they were very focused on tech they were also deeply religious/devote to God. Knowing this power could corrupt them they had built in safeguards against things like lust, gluttony, greed (seven deadly sins). While they could indulge in pleasures their tech/runes would prevent overindulgence/addiction and misuse. There was one (satan) who felt trapped by these restrictions he recognized the use but expressed that if God gave them freewill he can chose to not do wrong and that it shouldn't be inherently imposed upon him. He was quite intelligent and capable even amongst these ultra enhanced beings and was able to hack and alter the tech/runes. This led to "freedom" he could no indulge/kill with abandon. He also removed restrictions that were put in place to keep the beings from essentially mutating too far from what they were. This led to even greater strength if one chose though it would make the form grotesquely muscular (Overtkill from Spawn or The Maxx). They also became "smarter" in that their minds more easily conceived of ideas that involved darker ideals such as violance, torture, bribery, extortion. While the angels could think of these things their minds tended to stay in a happier place and they approached things from truth and thoughts of minimizing harm. satan had those that agreed with him and he showed them how to modify their own setup/"code". Not all modified themselves the same way this led to many of the powerful supernatural beings and the variety of demons (there was no demon archetype, where as the angels while not identical were more similar, kinda like the differences between modern day humans). They also created (in spite of protests of angels) their own beings and experimented with their genetics creating many monsters. Ultimately there was a war between the sects. Ultimately during a particularly violent battle (wielding weapons that seem just unreal) that would have resulted in the destruction of the galaxy God transported both to their own separate immaterial dimensions (heaven and hell). That way they couldn't cause more destruction on the inhabitants of the milky way , and he started humanity anew (adjusted to not become the same thing). Over the years demons plotted to return to the physical plane. They fed gullible and power hungry humans to do their bidding communicating to them through occult practices and dreams. They gave them power (over fellow humans), money, sex,  and tech in payment for their soul (which truly is something that transcends dimensions and exists in the true reality, and can go between dimensions as the border means nothing to them), allegiance, and submission. The contracts were bound by the runes and truly could not be broken without serious consequences as they were written into the fabric of the universe itself. Now in the future the large hadron collider was used in an attempt to bring demons here (by those in power/the know). It worked but the cover of experimenting on particles and understanding the universe sufficed for the public. Even the killing of people by police is really cover for demonic authority killing threats or gaining resources. All these beings started appearing in modern day leading to chaos and violence/battles. The corporate armies are a front/cover they actually work for the demons, but they will kill some monsters/demons publically to "sell the story". Thats where the opening scene comes in the squad recruit was on was meant to be killed by direct order of a high ranking demon as someone was seen as a threat (the new recruit). The high ranking commander didn't really believe he had turned but found it as a good cover for why he had to kill him / mark him as wanted. The vampire is a monster who regrets his existence/grapples with the fact that he was created by the demonas as a dark thing but this isn't what he chose. He doesnt believe he should go to hell (which they have all spean a long time in and it is beyond terrible the least of which is a hellraiser like experience) when he was created without permission as a hellish being, essentially he was destine for eternal torture, a destiny chosen for him. Ultimate ending (Jaime) and monsters can get redemption. Also God doesn't intervene most of the game leading many to question his desires,motives,existence. Many demons don't believe he exists some angels even question it.

fermi paradox ::
"The Fermi paradox is the apparent contradiction between the high statistical probability of extraterrestrial life existing in the vast universe and the lack of any definitive evidence of it. It essentially asks, "If the universe is so big and old, and conditions for life are so common, where is everyone?".
