🏙 First Level – Subway Vampire Den (Tutorial)

Purpose:

Introduce Neo (controls, combat basics).

Teach that something’s “off” with the corporate war (too easy, scripted).

End with betrayal → explosion/cave-in → black out.

Environment Style:

Architecture:

Abandoned subway tunnels, cracked tile walls, exposed rebar, concrete.

Subway cars (rusty, gutted, graffitied, makeshift barricades).

Flickering fluorescent lights, dripping water, cables dangling.

Vampire Den Dressing:

Torn cloth banners, improvised altars (blood splatter, candles).

Crates/coffins stacked like feeding/storage.

Corpses drained and slumped in corners.

Gameplay Features:

Narrow tunnels (teaches cover, dodging).

Larger “station” chamber for first big fight.

Collapsing walls/ceiling (explosion scripted to cause cave-in).

Wall Tiles Needed:

Subway brick/tiled walls (dirty white/cream tiles, cracked).

Support beams (metal girders).

Rock/rubble piles (for cave-ins).

Graffiti/decay overlays (optional variation tiles).

Vampire “decor” (cloth, candles, gore — could be wall overlays).

🏕 Camp – Cutoff Subway Section (Hub)

Purpose:

Safe zone hub between runs.

Grows from rubble to lively base as allies are redeemed.

Initial State (after blackout):

Collapsed tunnel, broken subway entrance → explains why the corps think you’re dead.

Small lit area with fire barrel, rubble, and makeshift bedrolls.

Only Neo/Morbius are present.

Evolving State (after runs, new allies):

Rugs, cloth partitions, lanterns/torches.

Crafting benches, shops, book stacks, reliquaries.

Characters add furniture, personal touches (Priest sets up candles + altar, Grotesque adds a lab table, etc.).

Wall Tiles Needed:

Collapsed concrete + broken tile subway walls.

Metal paneling (corrugated sheets, barricades).

Exposed piping.

Variants for “improvement” (hangings, rugs, lamps, shelves).

📐 Suggested Tileset Breakdown for Subway/Camp

Base Structure:

4–5 wall variants (cracked tile, plain concrete, graffiti, exposed rebar, collapsed rubble).

Supports:

Steel beams, concrete pillars.

Environmental Props:

Subway signage (EXIT, arrows, faded maps).

Doors (metal maintenance hatch, rusted sliding subway doors).

Rubble piles (as wall blockers).

Faction Decor (optional overlays):

Vampire banners, blood smears, candles → for the den.

Camp rugs, lamps, personal props → for the hub.

✅ The logic works:

Tutorial: A vampire den in a subway → leads to the betrayal/explosion.

Camp: Just a cutoff subway area where rubble isolates you from the corporate army → grows into your home base.

So, the first tileset you need to build is basically “abandoned subway” with two variations:

Infested Den (graffiti, blood, vampire touches).

Safe Camp (collapsed but gradually decorated).
